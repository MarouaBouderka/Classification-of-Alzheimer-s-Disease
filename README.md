# **Classification of Alzheimer's Disease**

## **Classification Approach**
Our model first determines whether a patient has **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease** or not.  
If Alzheimer's is detected, the model further categorizes the condition into one of the four stages:  
- **Mild Dementia**  
- **Moderate Dementia**  
- **Non-Dementia**  
- **Very Mild Dementia**  

## **Dataset**
This is the dataset used in the first part of this classification.

## **Models Used**
We utilize a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning models:  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT) + Transformer**  
- **Deep Learning (CNN-based models)**  
- **Random Forest + SVM**
